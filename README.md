# Game of Life

## Purpose
This repository contains an implementation of Conway's Game of Life. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

## Current Implementation
The current implementation includes:
- A grid-based representation of cells.
- Rules for cell survival, death, and reproduction.
- A user interface to visualize the evolution of the game over time.
